# AI Content Authenticity: A Move Smart Contract for Verification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
AI-generated content is becoming increasingly common, but verifying its authenticity remains a challenge. This Move smart contract on Aptos provides a **trustworthy mechanism** to register and verify AI-generated content by storing and retrieving cryptographic proofs. 

Through this contract, users can **register** their content hash, linking it to their address, ensuring **integrity** and **ownership**. Verification allows anyone to check the authenticity of the registered content.

## ðŸš€ Project Vision
The goal of this project is to **build a decentralized and reliable** proof system for AI-generated content. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:
- **Prevent unauthorized claims** over AI-generated work.
- **Enhance trust** in AI-generated content by offering an immutable proof mechanism.
- **Empower creators** to verify originality effortlessly.
- **Create a scalable solution** that can integrate with various AI platforms.

With this smart contract, the future of AI-driven creativity remains **transparent, secure, and verifiable**. ðŸš€
